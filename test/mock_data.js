  descriptLong: 'Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Cusco Region, Peru, above the Sacred Valley. Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was built as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472). Often mistakenly referred to as the “Lost City of the Incas” (a title more accurately applied to Vilcabamba), it is the most familiar icon of Inca civilization. The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later at the time of the Spanish Conquest. Although known locally, it was not known to the Spanish during the colonial period and remained unknown to the outside world until American historian Hiram Bingham brought it to international attention in 1911.',

  descriptLong: 'Niagara Falls is to waterfalls as the Great Wall of China is to walls, which is to say, it\'s not your average waterfall. Niagara Falls is really the collective name for three falls that straddle the United States/Canada border, as well as the names of the New York and Ontario cities that share the border. More than 3,000 tons of water thunder over the falls every second, and thousands of tourists are usually there to see it. Whether you plan to view Niagara Falls from the U.S. side or the Canadian side, it\'s possible to enjoy the sights without getting wet. But it\'s not as much fun.',
